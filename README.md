 Recommender Systems
Recommender systems is an active area of research and many algorithms have been proposed. For this
case study, one particular approach to recommendation — a form of content-based recommendation —
is considered. Given a set of target cases (i.e. items in a user’s profile; for example, movies seen, songs
listened to, or books read etc.), the objective is to recommend a ranked list of k other cases that are most
similar to these target cases.
The main considerations in content-based recommendation are (1) how cases are represented, (2) how
the similarity between cases is calculated, and (3) recommending cases to the end user
